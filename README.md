# BacteriophageDetective

# Introduction
This is a Linux-based python wrapper for a pipeline that takes in a collection of bacterial genomes to identify any prophages. The prophages are then annotated and analyzed.

# Installation/Dependencies

## Docker
Docker is a free and open platform for developing, deploying, and running software. Docker isolates your applications from your infrastructure, allowing you to deliver software quickly. On this platform, you can manage your infrastructure the same way you manage your applications Â  Docker lets you package and run an application within a container, which is a loosely isolated environment.

## Phigaro
Phigaro is a command-line tool that uses raw genome and metagenome assemblies as input to detect prophage areas. It also generates annotated 'prophage genome maps' and highlights potential transposon insertion sites inside prophages. It may be used to search for prophage areas in huge metagenomic datasets.
